## Motivation: Aerial Swarms

- Artistic performances (+ fireworks 2.0)
- Environmental Monitoring
- Documentation of Historical Monuments
- Inspection of Critical Infrastructure

## Motivation: Challenges for Researchers

1. Demonstrations are hard
    * Can easily spend 80% of research time

2. Overwhelming number of tools
    * Feature set, documentation, robustness, maintenance vary a lot

## Motivation: Goals

1. Users: How to *select* and *use* tools for aerial swarms research

2. Tool developers: understand *use-cases* and *alternatives* better

3. Long-term: converge to *fewer*, *better* tools

## Motivation: Non-Goals

* Exhaustive overview of simulation

    * [ICRA 2023 workshop on UAV simulation](https://imrclab.github.io/workshop-uav-sims-icra2023)

    * Resulting Survey Paper (IEEE RAM 2024, to appear)
