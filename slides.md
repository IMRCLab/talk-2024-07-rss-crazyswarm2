## Key Highlights

(perhaps recycle some of the plots from the last talk about user-base)

Support is key

<!-- Explain from scratch, i.e., without reference to Crazyswarm1 -->
# Overview

## Architecture

(picture from webpage)

## Robot Tracking

(motion_capture_tracking package)

<!-- Most likely no real slides, but live demo's instead -->
# Demos

## Assisted Teleop

(TODO: check if multi-joystick support works in the latest ROS version; goal: two joysticks and two robots)

## Figure 8

(All 5)
(reference to uav_trajectories for generation)

## Logging & Params

(Logging: perhaps something with plotjuggler?)
(Params: broadcast for all of them to play some music or change LEDs?)

## Simulation

(show interaction-aware swap example)

## Advanced 1

(distributed/slow computation?)
(collision avoidance?)
(formation control?)

# Conclusion

## Roadmap

1. Communication link issues
2. Scalability validation
3. More simulation backends
4. Release
